  description: "*Aquaman: Home is Calling* is a multiplayer MMORPG-esque underwater experience wherein the player becomes Aquaman to overcome trials to become the King of Atlantis. This game was sponsored by Warner Brothers and produced by Roblox in order to promote the then-upcoming Aquaman film. Working as part of a team for several months, we implemented custom solutions to problems like underwater pathfinding with navigation mesh generation, enemy AI, a polymorphic Unit system to model any combatant (be it a player or an AI-controlled NPC), and a state management system named Aurora."

Using Aurora can help you stay sane while managing complex game state when multiple parts of your game need to keep track of or change the same resource. *It's like Redux, but for games!*

  description: RadialSpriteSheetGenerator is a project that generates radial sprite sheets (what a surprise!). It is another project born out of necessity, because Roblox doesn't support clipping masks for images. It can generate a stereotypical "loading ring" or "circular progress indicator" out of any image you choose, paired with a Lua module that lets you pass in a percentage and it will autonatically pick the closest image from the sprite sheet.
