Working as part of a team for several months, we implemented custom solutions to problems like underwater pathfinding with navigation mesh generation, enemy AI, a polymorphic Unit system to model any combatant (be it a player or an AI-controlled NPC), and a state management system named Aurora."

  description: RadialSpriteSheetGenerator is a project that generates radial sprite sheets (what a surprise!). It is another project born out of necessity, because Roblox doesn't support clipping masks for images. It can generate a stereotypical "loading ring" or "circular progress indicator" out of any image you choose, paired with a Lua module that lets you pass in a percentage and it will autonatically pick the closest image from the sprite sheet.
